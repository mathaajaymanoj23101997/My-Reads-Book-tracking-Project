# MyReads: A Book Lending App

> Dustin D'Avignon

## About

This is the first project for the Udacity React Nanodegree. This project emphasizes the use of React with a given API server. The starter template contains the CSS and HTML for the project but omits the React code. I was able to build the React components to populate the main page and search page with books. THe main page has three shelves that users are able to move the books between shelves. The search page allows users to search for new books to add to their shelves. After selecting books to add to shelves, when you navigate back to the home page the you can instantly see the selections made on the search page. This project uses React's setState to build the functionality to move books from one shelf to another.
